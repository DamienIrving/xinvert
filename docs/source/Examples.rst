   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Examples
========

Classical problems include: Poisson equation, Gill-Matsuno model, Stommel-Munk
model, QG omega model, PV inversion, Swayer-Eliassen balance model... 

Users are also encouraged to add their own examples.

A complete list of the classical inversion problems can be found at
`this notebook <https://github.com/miniufo/xinvert/blob/master/notebooks/01.%20Introduction%20to%20xinvert.ipynb>`_.
